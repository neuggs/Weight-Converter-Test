# Weight Converter Test
The weight-converter-test is a re-creation of Progressive Web Application (PWA) tutorial by Bolaji Ayodeji. The tutorial can be found ta https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/build-your-first-progressive-web-app-a-weight-converter-app-and-deploy-to-netlify-b55ed4a86413.

A couple key concepts illustrated within this project:

1. How to build a simple PWA application. 
2. While the code can be deployed to Netlify, I used GitHub Pages to publish it right to GitHub. 

You can see the working appication via GitHub here: https://neuggs.github.io/Weight-Converter-Test/.
